# The-Ruler-of-Tsetlin-Automaton

This project is a visualised demo / Art Work of Tsetlin Automaton. The Tselin Automaton algorithm was proposed by Michael Lvovitch Tsetlin. An another Tsetlin art work can be view in:https://github.com/JieGH/The-Ruler-of-Tsetlin-Automaton/blob/master/Capture_another.JPG


The algoritum of Tsetlin Automaton can be found in:
https://github.com/cair/convolutional-tsetlin-machine

A newly invented AI algorithm Tsetlin Machine had been proposed by Dr Ole-Christoffer GranmoTsetlin and his team. The details of this algorithm can be found in  
https://github.com/cair/TsetlinMachine and https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01508

-------------------
The ruler of Tsetlin automaton is a simple visualised demo of 6 states Testlin Automation. The red LEDs will indicate the state of Tsetlin Automaton and the state will be changed when the 'clock' signal had been triggered. The changing of the states will follow the Tsetlin Automaton algorithm which are: 1) states will migrate towards middle states when penalty had been issued, the state will change to first or final states when reward had been issued. 

The simple video demo can be found in this YouTube link:
